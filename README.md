# flask-webserver
This project was adapted from the Flask Tutorial, found [here](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog),
in accordance with the MIT License found in the LICENSE file.

This project showcases a basic Flask server built using Python, HTML, and CSS to organize and display text-based data chronologically. 
To achieve this goal, there is in-built functionality for the creation and management of unique user accounts, each of which contains a privilege,
account name, and password which are encrypted an stored in a local database. Additionally, there is included functionality for cron-based scheduling to
facilitate the publishing of text at future dates.
